ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Sanjna , a passionate frontend developer with a knack for crafting delightful user experiences through clean and efficient code. As I journey through the realms of web development, I'm on a mission to blend creativity with functionality, one line of code at a time.

ðŸš€ Currently honing my skills in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks such as React and Angular, I'm committed to staying ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving landscape of web development.

ðŸ’¡ Excited to expand my horizons, I'm diving into the world of full-stack development, eager to explore backend technologies like Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and SQL. I believe that mastering both frontend and backend will empower me to bring complete, end-to-end solutions to life.

ðŸ”¨ When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me exploring the latest trends in design, experimenting with new development tools, or being fascinated about AI!

ðŸŒ± I'm always open to learning, collaborating, and sharing insights with fellow developers. Feel free to connect, exchange ideas, or collaborate on projects that drive innovation and make a positive impact.

Let's build remarkable experiences together! ðŸ’»âœ¨
